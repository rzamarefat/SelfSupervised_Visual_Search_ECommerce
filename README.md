# Self-Supervised Visual Search Ecommerce
#### Description
A fullstack vision-based web application for recommending similar products

#### Demo



#### Technologies
- Self-Supervised approaches: SimCLR, BYOL
- Deep Learning: Pytorch
- Similarity search: [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
- Backend: FastAPI
- Frontend: React JS and Redux
- Mark-up and style: HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

#### Overall procedure

#### Instruction to set-up
- In the src directory you can find the related setup instruction for back and frontend seperately. 
- It requires common steps taken in any React and FastAPI app. So don't worry.

#### Dataset:
- [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset)

#### Pre-Trained weights:
- In the src/back directory you can find a file named 'epoch=19-step=2960.ckpt'

#### Refs:
- [SimCLR paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709)
- [BYOL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733)
- For SimCLR implementation, I have lost the link and now I can't find where I previously saw it.
